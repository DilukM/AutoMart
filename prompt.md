**User:** Change the entity to add a new column named "isFeatued". Need to change all the particular places inside the vehicle feature according to that. Follow the existing architecture.

**Copilot:** I'll help you add a new isFeatured column to the Vehicle entity and update all related places in the vehicle feature. Let me start by examining the current Vehicle entity and then identify all the places that need to be updated.

Now let me read some key files to understand the current structure better:

 Read IVehicleRepository.ts, lines 1 to 50

 Read IVehicleRepository.ts, lines 50 to 60

 Read VehicleRepository.ts, lines 1 to 80

Now I have a good understanding of the architecture. Let me start implementing the changes by adding the isFeatured property to the Vehicle entity and all related components.

1. First, let's update the Vehicle entity:

`Vehicle.ts+1-0`

Now I need to fix the create and update methods to include the isFeatured parameter:

`Vehicle.ts+3-1`

`Vehicle.ts+3-1`

2. Now let's update the VehicleEntity (database entity):

`VehicleEntity.ts+3-0`

3. Update the repository interfaces:

`IVehicleRepository.ts+1-0`

`IVehicleRepository.ts+1-0`

`IVehicleRepository.ts+1-0`

4. Update the VehicleRepository implementation:

Read VehicleRepository.ts, lines 80 to 141

Now I need to update the VehicleRepository to handle the isFeatured filter and update the mapEntityToDomain method:

`VehicleRepository.ts+5-0`

`VehicleRepository.ts+1-0`

5. Update the VehicleService:

Read VehicleService.ts, lines 40 to 80

I need to update the VehicleService to handle the isFeatured field:

`VehicleService.ts+3-1`

6. Update the CreateVehicleDTO:

`CreateVehicleDTO.ts+2-0`

`CreateVehicleDTO.ts+4-0`

7. Update the UpdateVehicleDTO:

`UpdateVehicleDTO.ts+1-0`

`UpdateVehicleDTO.ts+4-0`

8. Update the VehicleController:

`VehicleController.ts+1-0`

`VehicleController.ts+1-0`

Now I need to update the controller to include isFeatured in the response objects. Let me find and update those:

`VehicleController.ts+1-0`

**User:**  Now I want to get the featured vehicles at the top of the list in getAllVehicles function.

**Copilot:** I'll modify the getAllVehicles function to prioritize featured vehicles at the top of the list. I need to update the repository's findAll method to sort by the isFeatured field first.

Let me first update the VehicleRepository to include the ordering logic:

Read VehicleRepository.ts, lines 80 to 100

 `VehicleRepository.ts+2-0`

Now let me also continue updating the remaining parts of the VehicleController to include the isFeatured field in all response objects. Let me find the other places where vehicle data is returned:

Searched text for data: {.*id: vehicle.*} (**/*VehicleController.ts), no results

Let me check these specific locations and update them to include the isFeatured field:

Read VehicleController.ts, lines 140 to 160

Let me be more specific by including more context:

`VehicleController.ts+1-0`

Now let me check the getAllVehicles response (around line 211):

Read VehicleController.ts, lines 200 to 230

`VehicleController.ts+1-0`

Now let me check the updateVehicle response (around line 322):

Read VehicleController.ts, lines 315 to 350

`VehicleController.ts+1-0`

Now let me check and update the createVehicle method to handle the isFeatured field:

Read VehicleController.ts, lines 70 to 100

Read VehicleController.ts, lines 40 to 70

Read VehicleController.ts, lines 20 to 40

I need to update the createVehicle method to handle the isFeatured field from the request body:

`VehicleController.ts+1-0`

`VehicleController.ts+1-0`

Now let me update the frontend types to include the isFeatured field:

`common.ts+1-0`

`common.ts+1-0`

Now let me update the test files to include the isFeatured field:

`VehicleService.test.ts+1-0`

Let me update the in-memory test repository to handle the isFeatured field:

Read inMemoryVehicleRepository.ts, lines 1 to 30

`inMemoryVehicleRepository.ts+2-1`

Let me also check the findAll method in the test repository to ensure it handles the isFeatured filter and ordering correctly:

Read inMemoryVehicleRepository.ts, lines 30 to 83

I need to update the findAll and update methods in the test repository to handle the isFeatured field:

`inMemoryVehicleRepository.ts+11-1`

`inMemoryVehicleRepository.ts+2-1`

Now let me create a database migration script to add the isFeatured column to the existing database:

Created addIsFeaturedColumn.ts

Let me check the existing package.json to see what scripts are available and add a script to run the migration:

Read package.json, lines 1 to 30

Let me add a script to run the migration:

Using "Replace String in File"

`package.json+1-0`

Now let me test that the implementation is working by running the backend:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\Diluk\Downloads\Car sale management\back" && npm run dev:nodemon
```

Checked background terminal output

Great! The server is running successfully. Now let me run the migration to add the isFeatured column to the database:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\Diluk\Downloads\Car sale management\back" && npm run migrate:featured
```

Let me open a new terminal session to run the migration:

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Diluk/Downloads/Car sale management/back" && npm run migrate:featured
```

I need to load the environment variables. Let me check if there's a .env file:

Read back

Good, there's a .env file. Let me update the migration script to load environment variables:

`addIsFeaturedColumn.ts+4-0`

Now let me run the migration again:

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Diluk/Downloads/Car sale management/back" && npm run migrate:featured
```

Let me check the .env file to see what's configured:

Read .env, lines 1 to 20

The environment variables look correct. Let me check the database configuration file to see why it's not reading them properly:

Read database.ts, lines 1 to 40

The issue is that the database configuration is being imported and executed before the dotenv.config() is called. Let me update the migration script to fix this:

`addIsFeaturedColumn.ts+4-3`

Now let me run the migration again:

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Diluk/Downloads/Car sale management/back" && npm run migrate:featured
```

Excellent! The migration ran successfully, and it appears the isFeatured column already exists in the database. Now let me create a summary of what we've implemented.
